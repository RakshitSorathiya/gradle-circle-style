Gradle Circle Style
===================

A plugin for Gradle that integrates [Checkstyle] and [FindBugs] output into [CircleCI].

[Checkstyle]: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html
[CircleCI]: https://circleci.com/
[FindBugs]: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/findbugs_plugin.html

Quickstart
----------

Add the following to your project's top-level build.gradle file:

```gradle

plugins {
  id 'com.palantir.circle.style' version '0.2'
}
```

And now your CircleCI builds will fail with nice summaries:

![CHECKSTYLE â€” 1 FAILURE](images/checkstyle-circle-failure.png?raw=true "CircleCI failure image")

Details
-------

This plugin is enabled by the `CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS` environment variable, set automatically on CircleCI builds. It then automatically enables XML output for the plugins, and adds a finalizer task that converts these to the JUnit XML output that CircleCI expects.

Note that FindBugs does not support generating both HTML and XML output, so HTML output will be disabled on CircleCI builds. (Checkstyle does not have this limitation.)
